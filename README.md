# Support-Vector-Machine-SVM

Dataset is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of several hundred human cell sample records, each of which contains the values of a set of cell characteristics

Feature set - The ID field contains the patient identifiers and the characteristics of the cell samples from each patient are contained in fields Clump to Mit. The values are graded from 1 to 10, with 1 being the closest to benign.

Target - The Class field contains the diagnosis, as confirmed by separate medical procedures, as to whether the samples are benign (value = 2) or malignant (value = 4).

So using support vector machine a model is created to predict whether the new case belongs to benign or malignant
